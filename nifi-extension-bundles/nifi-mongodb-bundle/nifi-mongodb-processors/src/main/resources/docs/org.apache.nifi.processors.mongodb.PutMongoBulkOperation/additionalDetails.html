<!-- Processor Documentation ================================================== -->
<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
    This processor runs bulk updates against MongoDB collections. The flowfile content is expected to be a JSON array with bulk write operations as described in the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.bulkWrite/" target="_blank">manual for db.collection.bulkWrite</a>.
</p>
<p>
    You can use all (currently 6) operators described there. The flowfile content is returned as-is. You can merge many operations into one - and get massive performance improvements.
</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>
    The following is an example flowfile content that does two things: insert a new document, and update all documents where value of <em>hey</em> is greater than zero.
</p>
<code>
            <pre>
                [
                    {"insertOne": {"document": {"ho": 42}}},
                    {"updateMany": {"filter": {"hey": {"$gt": 0}}, "update": {"$inc": {"hey": 2}}}}
                ]
            </pre>
</code>
