<h1>AsanaClientService</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
    This service manages credentials to Asana, and provides a common API for the processors to work on
    the user specified workspace (or organization).
</p>

<h3>Using a custom Asana instance</h3>
<p>
    If you have an Asana instance running on your custom domain, then you need to specify the <em>API URL</em>
    of that instance. For example: <code>https://asana.example.com/api/1.0</code>
</p>

<h3>Authentication</h3>
<p>
    Asana supports a few methods of authenticating with the API. Simple cases are usually handled with a
    personal access token, while multi-user apps utilize OAuth.<br />
    <br />
    Asana provides three ways to authenticate:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://developers.asana.com/docs/oauth">OAuth</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://developers.asana.com/docs/personal-access-token">Personal access token (PAT)</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://developers.asana.com/docs/openid-connect">OpenID Connect</a></li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <strong>Note:</strong> This service currently only supports <em>Personal access tokens</em> as authentication method.</br>
    <br />
    Personal access tokens (PATs) are a useful mechanism for accessing the API in scenarios where OAuth would
    be considered overkill, such as access from the command line and personal scripts or applications. A user
    can create many, but not unlimited, personal access tokens. When creating a token, you must give it a
    description to help you remember what you created the token for.<br />
    Remember to keep your tokens secret and treat them just like passwords. Your tokens act on your behalf when interacting with the API.<br />
    <br />
    You can generate a personal access token from the <a href="https://app.asana.com/0/developer-console">Asana developer console</a>.
    See the <a href="https://developers.asana.com/docs/authentication-quick-start">Authentication quick start</a> for detailed
    instructions on getting started with PATs.
</p>

<h3>Workspaces & Organizations</h3>
<p>
    A <em>workspace</em> is the highest-level organizational unit in Asana. All projects and tasks have an associated workspace.<br />
    <br />
    An <em>organization</em> is a special kind of <em>workspace</em> that represents a company. In an organization, you can group your<br />
    projects into teams. You can read more about how organizations work on the <a href="https://asana.com/guide/help/workspaces/basics">Asana Guide</a>.<br />
    <br />
    You can read more about how objects are organized in Asana in the <a href="https://developers.asana.com/docs/object-hierarchy">developer guide</a>.
