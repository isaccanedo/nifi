To build the extension API Project:

First, update the version in the pyproject.toml file. After deploying to the pypi repository,
the version cannot be overwritten. So you will need to create a unique version.

Build the distribution artifacts:
```
cd ${nifi-python-extension-api-dir}/src/main/python
rm -rf dist/*
python3 -m build
```

This will create several files in the dist/ directory.
These can then be uploaded to the testpypi repository:

```
python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

You will be prompted for a username and password. For the username, use __token__. For the password, use the token value, including the pypi- prefix.
